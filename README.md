## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library



### What I learned

This project helped me to learn a lot on how to use Tailwind to style and for mobile responsiveness
If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I hope to improve myself on tailwind and other frameworks
